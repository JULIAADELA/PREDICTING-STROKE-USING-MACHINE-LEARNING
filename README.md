# PREDICTING-STROKE-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Stroke is the second greatest cause of death worldwide and the third leading cause of disability. One in every four people is at risk of having a stroke in their lifetime. Early awareness of the various stroke hazards can reduce the risk of a stroke. Predicting a stroke is critical for avoiding serious health consequences or death. The objective of my research paper is to detect stroke risk in patients by using machine learning classification algorithms on features derived from available dataset. It will help us determine which algorithm is best suited and accurate for stroke prediction. Models used for stroke prediction included Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, and experimental findings were analyzed using Jupyter Notebook. Among the supervised machine learning methods described, the Random Forest technique has the best classification accuracy (CA) of 94.9%. As a result, Random Forest is an almost perfect classifier for stroke prediction, allowing doctors and patients to prescribe and recognize potential strokes early on.
